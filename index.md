The urge to make dreams come true is guiding me along a path to learn computer more and more.
Yes, there were some times when I got deeply involved into a task and missed lunch, but had
a virtual meal by solving a problem (Using Python. Yes, python can do anything.)<br>

<code>$pip install food</code><br>

<code>>>>from food.Italian import pizza<br>>>>pizza("Onion", "Bell Pepper")</code><br>

Fun Aside,<br>
I\`m a Software Engineer capable of learning and solving any computer related issue. Although my
expertise lies in python programming, I can architect, develop and maintain a software platform or
an application.<br>
