<p style="text-align: justify">True Dat. But I know how to order food using a python script (python can do anything).</p>

<font size="4"><code>$pip install food</code></font><br>

<font size="4"><code>>>>from food.Italian import pizza<br>>>>pizza("Onion", "Bell Pepper")</code></font><br>

<p style="text-align: justify">Fun Aside,<br>
I am a Software Engineer capable of learning and solving any computer related issue. Although my
expertise lies in python programming, I can architect, develop and maintain any software platform or
an application.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I use python to analyze data, write pattern recognition algorithms(Machine Learning) and make
my life easier by writing little scripts whenever I felt my task is becoming repetitive. I have written and
published python libraries in my current company. I am a full stack developer
knowing how to write backend services in Java and visualize it with charts and tables in react front-end single page applications. Expert in container orchestration using Kubernetes and Openshift while knowing very much about
building and publishing docker images. I have gained vast amount of knowledge on linux as I have worked mostly on Servers
running RHEL and Ubuntu. While the software stack goes on, I know the networking concepts very well and can help
 fix security issues and better design the application. I thank the open source communities which made lot of our
 code be optimized and meet the standards.</p>

 Current Goals:<br>
  # Ethical hacking<br>
  # Contribute to open source world
